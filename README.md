# PocketLlama 🦙

PocketLlama is a privacy-first, fully local AI chat application for iOS and iPadOS. It allows you to run powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) directly on your device, ensuring your conversations remain private and never leave your pocket.

## ✨ Key Features

* **100% Local Inference**: Chat with AI without an internet connection using high-performance local processing.
* **Curated Model Library**: Choose from a variety of optimized models including Gemma 3 (270M & 1B), Llama 3.2 (3B), Qwen 2.5 (0.5B), and Phi-3 Mini.
* **Smart Download Manager**: Browse and manage your model collection with real-time disk usage tracking.
* **Performance Metrics**: View detailed stats for every model, including storage size, context window, speed, and accuracy scores.
* **Customizable Experience**:
    * **Answer Styles**: Toggle between "Simple" for concise replies and "Detailed" for in-depth responses.
    * **Adaptive UI**: Full support for Light Mode, Dark Mode, and system-wide appearance settings.
    * **Multi-Device Optimization**: Tailored layouts for iPhone using a Tab Bar and iPad using a Sidebar/Split View.

## 🛠️ How It Works

PocketLlama leverages the **LLM.swift** framework to handle local inference. The app is built entirely with **SwiftUI**, providing a modern and responsive user experience across Apple devices.

### Model Specifications
The app provides transparent "hard stats" for every model in the library:
* **Storage**: View the exact space required before downloading.
* **Context Window**: Check the supported token limit (e.g., 32k or 128k).
* **Compute Load**: Models are ranked from "Light" to "High" to help you choose the best fit for your hardware.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Download a Model**: Navigate to the **Library** tab and select a model that fits your device's storage and performance capabilities.
2. **Select Your Model**: Once the download is complete, the model can be selected in the **Settings** tab for use in new chats.
3. **Start Chatting**: Go to the **Chat** tab to begin a private session with your local AI.

## 🛡️ Privacy First

No trackers. No cloud processing. No subscriptions. PocketLlama is designed to be a transparent and secure tool for local machine learning exploration.
